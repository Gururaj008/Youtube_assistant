The Streamlit application “Youtube Assistant using Langchain and OPENAI” is a sophisticated tool that leverages the power of machine learning and natural language processing to enhance the user’s interaction with YouTube content. The application accepts a YouTube URL and a user question as inputs, and uses similarity search on a vector database containing embeddings to provide relevant answers. This is achieved by transforming the content of the YouTube video into a searchable vector database using Langchain and OpenAI technologies.

The application begins by loading the transcript of the provided YouTube video using the YoutubeLoader class. The transcript is then split into manageable chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class, and these chunks are transformed into vector embeddings using the OpenAIEmbeddings class. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database.

When a user poses a question, the application performs a similarity search on the vector database to identify the most relevant information to answer the user’s query. The application uses the LLMChain class to generate a detailed response based on the user’s question and the content of the video transcript. If the question is beyond the scope of the video transcript, the application will respond with “Sorry! The question is out of the current context”.

This application serves as a powerful tool for users who wish to extract specific information from YouTube content without having to watch the entire video. Whether it’s a lecture, tutorial, documentary, or any other informational content, the “Youtube Assistant using Langchain and OPENAI” streamlines the process of finding the answers you need. It’s like having a personal assistant for your YouTube viewing experience!
